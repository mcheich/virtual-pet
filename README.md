# Virtual-Pet "Fox_e"

This is a game I designed at WCCIT to practice Java Fundamentals and Test Driven Development.


## Things I am not sure I have done correctly and would love feedback on:

* Did I implement setter and getter methods correctly/appropriately?
* *Should* I use the `this` keyword in the getters and setters?  
* *Must* I use the `this` keyword to disambiguate?
* Do the comments above the methods in the VirtualPet Class follow the correct form? 

## Questions in general about TDD
1. Do my JUnit Tests look OK? Do I have enough of them? Too many?
2. *I think* I'd like to test drive the production of the VirtualPetApp, would that makes sense?
3. If I were to Test Drive the VirtualPetApp, I am not sure how to go about it. I can't figure out is how I would "feed" console input into the tests.
